This is an old university project I had to in my ASP.NET course.
Also, my first time using ASP.NET and Github, so don't judge :)

I know it has a lot of sh#t but left it anyway for historical reasons.

Basically, the requirements of the task were "Copy the credit, refinance and lease calculator from https://www.moitepari.bg/ without any other information on how to do the calculations.
